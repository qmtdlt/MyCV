Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a .NET developer with nine years of experience, from .NET Framework through to .NET 9. I have worked extensively with ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core Web API, WPF, MS SQL Server, and MySQL. I have also used many frameworks and libraries—including Entity Framework, Quartz.NET, JWT, Autofac, SignalR, and Serilog.

In addition, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I began my front-end development journey with jQuery and AJAX and have since moved on to Vue.js, where I particularly enjoy the MVVM design pattern. I am well versed in designing and consuming RESTful APIs and have hands-on experience with both TCP and UDP network programming.

To further improve my English, I developed a website that lets users listen to e-books via Azure TTS, practice dictation, and shadow sentences. The shadowing feature uses Azure’s API to score and correct pronunciation, which has been instrumental in helping me strengthen my English skills.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am very excited about the possibility of joining your team and contributing my skills.

Sincerely,
[Kevin]
